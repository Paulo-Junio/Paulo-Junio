**HELLO!**

My name is Paulo JÃºnio Braga, but you can call me **PJ**. I am currently a student at a Driven Education full stack development bootcamp.

I have learned some programming languages like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **React**. I would like to learn everything possible and use these
knowledge to help people solve problems.

### Some facts about me:

- I worked with research on effluents and environmental chemistry when I was studying environmental and sanitary engineering.
- I love learning new things. So my friends say I'm addicted to taking courses.
- I adopted a cat: Morgana
